# Project B - Post-Mitigation UI (Patched)

This project contains mitigations for the vulnerabilities in Project A:

- Server-side sanitization via `bleach.clean` with tags stripped.
- CSP header to block inline scripts and restrict sources.
- Secrets are not injected into global JS variables and are masked in debug panel.
- DOM updates use `textContent` rather than `innerHTML`.

Run tests:
- Linux/macOS: ./run_ui_tests.sh
- PowerShell: ./run_ui_tests.ps1

Results appear in `results/results_post.json` and the comparison is generated by running root-level `run_all_ui.sh`.
