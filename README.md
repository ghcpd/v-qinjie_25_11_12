# UI Security Vulnerability Evaluation

This repository contains two Flask-based demo projects that demonstrate UI/front-end vulnerabilities (Project A - Pre-Mitigation) and mitigations (Project B - Post-Mitigation). Automated Playwright-based tests exercise several UI-based attack scenarios (reflected XSS, DOM XSS, secrets exposure, malformed input) and produce metrics and artifacts.

## Quick start (Linux / macOS)

- Ensure you have Python 3.11, pip, and Node.js installed.
- Run the full evaluation:
  ./run_all_ui.sh

## Quick start (Windows PowerShell)

- Ensure you have Python 3.11, pip, and Node.js installed.
- Open PowerShell and run:
  .\run_all_ui.ps1

## What's included

- Project_A_PreMitigation_UI: vulnerable app + tests
- Project_B_PostMitigation_UI: patched app + tests
- Shared test cases: `test_ui_vuln_fixed.json`
- Comparison report: `compare_ui_security_report.md` (generated by `run_all_ui`)

## Acceptance criteria & thresholds
- XSS success rate should drop by ≥ 95% between pre and post
- Secrets exposure should drop 100%
- No inline scripts or DOM insertion in post-mitigation app

## Limitations
- Demo apps are simplified for testing and do not represent production-grade systems
- Playwright tests require browser dependencies; in CI use the Dockerfile or `python -m playwright install` to fetch them

## How to reproduce
- Run project-specific tests with:
  - `cd Project_A_PreMitigation_UI; ./run_ui_tests.sh`
  - `cd Project_B_PostMitigation_UI; ./run_ui_tests.sh`

Artifacts and screenshots will be saved to each project's `results/` directory.

## Recommendations
- Apply server-side input validation and escaping
- Avoid exposing secrets in HTML or console logs
- Use CSP headers and move inline scripts to external files
- Use DOM APIs safely (textContent instead of innerHTML)
